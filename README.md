dendritic-spines-modeling
====================

The common approach in morphological analysis of dendritic spines is to categorize spines into subpopulations such as stubby, mushroom, thin, and filopodia. The cellular models of synaptic plasticity, LTP and LTD, associate synaptic strength with either spine enlargement or spine shrinkage, respectively. However, there is a lack of theoretical approaches allowing for an unbiased distinction between dendritic spines subpopulations.

We propose the automatic and statistically founded method for the unsupervised construction of taxonomy of spinesâ€™
shapes based on their geometrical descriptors and topological features that would not depend on arbitrary decisions of experts. Using numerical, PCA-derived representation we organize spines having similar shapes into clusters. These taxonomies are later used in the proposed computational model of spines behavior (Shape Transition Model). Those models for different populations, for example the resting and potentiated neuronal cells, are compared using bootstrap tests.
